# Fuzzy-Systems-Classification
The aim of this work is to explore the ability of models TSK in solving classification problems. Specifically, two data sets are selected from the UCI repository for the purpose of sorting, from the available data, samples in their respective classes, using vague neural models. The work consists of two parts, the first of which is intended for a simple investigation of the educational process and evaluation of TSK models, while the second includes a more systematic approach to the problem of data learning, combined with pre-processing steps such as feature selection and model optimization methods through cross validation (cross validation).

# Fuzzy-Systems-Regression
The aim of this work is to explore the ability of models TSK in the modeling of multivariate, non-linear functions. Specifically, two data sets are selected from the UCI repository for the purpose of estimating the variable target from the available data, using ambiguities neural models. The first set of data will be used for one simple investigation of the process of training and evaluating its models of the genre, as well as for a bandage of ways of analyzing and interpreting the results. The second, more complex set of data will be used for a more complete modeling process, which will include, among other things, pre-processing steps such as feature selection, as well as methods for optimizing models through cross validation.
