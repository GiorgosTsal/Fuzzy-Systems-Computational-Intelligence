# Fuzzy-Systems-Classification
The aim of this work is to explore the ability of models TSK in solving classification problems. Specifically, two data sets are selected from the UCI repository for the purpose of sorting, from the available data, samples in their respective classes, using vague neural models. The work consists of two parts, the first of which is intended for a simple investigation of the educational process and evaluation of TSK models, while the second includes a more systematic approach to the problem of data learning, combined with pre-processing steps such as feature selection and model optimization methods through cross validation (cross validation).
